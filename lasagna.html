            <p>I am so excited for you to try this for your friends and family!</p>
        
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>13 x 9 Pan</li>
                <li>2 boxes No Boil Lasagna Sheets</li>
                <li>2 Chicken Breasts boneless skinless; boiled and shredded</li>
                <li>1 jar Your Favorite Hot Sauce (I used Frank's RedHot Buffalo Wing Sauce-12 oz)</li>
                <li>1 cup Cheddar Cheese grated</li>
                <li>5 tbsp Butter</li>
                <li>4 tbsp Flour</li>
                <li>4 cups Milk</li>
                <li>2 tsp Salt</li>
                <li>4 oz Blue Cheese</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees.</li>
                <li>To make your bechamel sauce, heat the butter over medium-low heat in a medium sauce pan until melted. Add the flour and whisk until smooth. Turn the heat up to medium and cook until the mixture turns a light, golden color (about 5 minutes).
                    Meanwhile, heat the 4 cups of milk in a separate pot until hot (not boiling). Add the hot milk, 1 cup at a time, to the butter/flour mix and whisk continuously until smooth. Bring to a boil. Cook 10 minutes, stirring constantly, then remove from heat and add your blue cheese and salt. Stir until most of it has melted. Add pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Mix the boiled chicken, 1/2 cup of the cheddar and the jar of hot sauce together in a bowl, set aside.</li>
                <li>Make the lasagna! This part is simple. Start with a layer of your white sauce on the bottom and then layer as follows:
                    -Pasta
                    -Buffalo chicken mix
                    -Pasta
                    -White sauce.
                    Repeat this 3 times until you are out of mixture. Your last layer should be pasta covered with the white sauce. Make sure to save enough white sauce for the end or the top of the lasagna could get a little crunchy (may not be a bad thing though)!</li>
                <li>Cover the entire pan in tinfoil and bake for 1 hour. Uncover, top with remaining cheese and bake for 10 more minutes.</li>
            </ol>
