        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (12-16 ounce) pizza dough</li>
            <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) packet of taco seasoning</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can refried beans</li>
            <li>1/4 cup salsa</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese , (or Mexican blend cheese)</li>
            <li>sliced olives, (about 1/4 cup)</li>
            <li>Toppings: diced tomatoes, sliced green onions, sour cream, and taco sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Let pizza dough rest at room temperature for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>While dough is resting, brown beef in a large skillet. Add the taco seasoning, add water called for on the package, and cook according to the package instructions. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Press the or roll the dough onto a 12-inch pizza pan, pizza stone, or larger pan.</li>
            <li>Bake for 8 minutes. Remove from oven.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir together the refried beans and salsa. Spread a thin layer onto the pizza crust. If you are using a 12-inch pan you might not need all of it. If you're using a larger pizza pan or a 9x13 pan you will use all of it.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with the ground beef mixture, cheese, and olives. Bake for about 5 minutes or until cheese is completely melted. Remove from the oven and top with tomatoes and green onions. You can add a dollop of sour cream to the center or let everyone top their own. Add taco sauce if desired.</li>
